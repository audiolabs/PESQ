PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) Wrapper for Python [Updated for P.862 Corrigendum 2 (03/18)]

# Description 
This code is an updated version of /ludlows/pesq/ which implements the Corrigendum 2 of the ITU-T P.862 recommendation (PESQ). The correction addresses the under-prediction of subjective scores (by 0.8 MOS on average) by correcting the level of the loudness model.


This code is designed for numpy array specially.

# Requirements

    C compiler
    numpy
    cython


# Install with pip

```bash
# PyPi Repository
$ pip install pesq

# The Latest Version
$ pip install https://github.com/ludlows/python-pesq/archive/master.zip
```

# Usage for narrowband and wideband Modes

Please note that the sampling rate (frequency) should be 16000 or 8000 (Hz). 

A sample rate of 8000 Hz is supported only in narrowband mode.

The code supports error-handling behaviors now.

```python
def pesq(fs, ref, deg, mode='wb', on_error=PesqError.RAISE_EXCEPTION):
    """
    Args:
        ref: numpy 1D array, reference audio signal 
        deg: numpy 1D array, degraded audio signal
        fs:  integer, sampling rate
        mode: 'wb' (wide-band) or 'nb' (narrow-band)
        on_error: error-handling behavior, it could be PesqError.RETURN_VALUES or PesqError.RAISE_EXCEPTION by default
    Returns:
        pesq_score: float, P.862.2 Prediction (MOS-LQO)
    """
```
Once you select `PesqError.RETURN_VALUES`, the `pesq` function will return -1 when an error occurs.

Once you select `PesqError.RAISE_EXCEPTION`, the `pesq` function will raise an exception when an error occurs.

It now supports the following errors: `InvalidSampleRateError`, `OutOfMemoryError`,`BufferTooShortError`,`NoUtterancesError`,`PesqError`(other unknown errors).

```python
from scipy.io import wavfile
from pesq import pesq

rate, ref = wavfile.read("./audio/speech.wav")
rate, deg = wavfile.read("./audio/speech_bab_0dB.wav")

print(pesq(rate, ref, deg, 'wb'))
print(pesq(rate, ref, deg, 'nb'))
```

# Usage for `multiprocessing` feature

```python
def pesq_batch(fs, ref, deg, mode='wb', n_processor=None, on_error=PesqError.RAISE_EXCEPTION):
    """
   Running `pesq` using multiple processors
    Args:
        on_error:
        ref: numpy 1D (n_sample,) or 2D array (n_file, n_sample), reference audio signal
        deg: numpy 1D (n_sample,) or 2D array (n_file, n_sample), degraded audio signal
        fs:  integer, sampling rate
        mode: 'wb' (wide-band) or 'nb' (narrow-band)
        n_processor: cpu_count() (default) or number of processors (chosen by the user) or 0 (without multiprocessing)
        on_error: PesqError.RAISE_EXCEPTION (default) or PesqError.RETURN_VALUES
    Returns:
        pesq_score: list of pesq scores, P.862.2 Prediction (MOS-LQO)
    """
```
This function uses `multiprocessing` features to boost time efficiency.

When the `ref` is an 1-D numpy array and `deg` is a 2-D numpy array, the result of `pesq_batch` is identical to the value of `[pesq(fs, ref, deg[i,:],**kwargs) for i in range(deg.shape[0])]`.

When the `ref` is a 2-D numpy array and `deg` is a 2-D numpy array, the result of `pesq_batch` is identical to the value of `[pesq(fs, ref[i,:], deg[i,:],**kwargs) for i in range(deg.shape[0])]`.


# Correctness

The correctness is verified by running samples in the audio folder.

PESQ computed by this code in wideband mode is    1.5128041505813599 ~~1.0832337141036987~~ [due to Corrigendum 2]

PESQ computed by this code in narrowband mode is  1.6072081327438354

# Note

Sampling rate (fs|rate) - No default. You must select either 8000Hz or 16000Hz.
 
Note there is narrowband (nb) mode only when the sampling rate is 8000Hz.

The original C source code is modified.
